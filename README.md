## Description
The **Test Markdown App** is a web application designed to convert Markdown content into HTML using the `marked.js` library. This application allows users to load Markdown files from attachments, convert the content to HTML, and display the output in a designated `#markdown-output` div. The app is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive design and incorporates `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting of code blocks.

## Features

- Load Markdown content from user-uploaded attachments.
- Display converted HTML in a styled output section.
- Responsive design powered by Bootstrap.
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks using `highlight.js`.

## Code Explanation
The application is structured primarily around the following key components:

- **HTML Structure:** The layout is built with Bootstrap classes for a responsive design. The main components include:
  - A file input for uploading Markdown files.
  - A `div` with the ID `markdown-output` to display the converted HTML.

- **JavaScript Functionality:**
  - The `marked.js` library is utilized to convert Markdown text to HTML.
  - An event listener is set up to handle file uploads, reading the contents of the Markdown file, and passing it to the `marked()` function.
  - `highlight.js` is integrated to provide syntax highlighting for any code blocks present in the Markdown content.

- **Styling:** Bootstrap is used to ensure the application is visually appealing and responsive across different devices.
